                    <h2>Observe</h2>
                    Take a minute or two to study your surroundings. Listen, watch. Try and really observe everything that is around you. Take note of what is happening, what things sound like. What they feel like. Let yourself be distracted by anything that catches your eye, and really try to think about the world around you in this moment of time.

                            Did you notice anything about the people around you? What are they doing? Each individual is caught up within their own distinct world, living a life that although separate from your own, is still filled with the rich experiences and emotions that we all encounter every day. There is wonder that can be found in witnessing others experience the world when we recognize that we all have lives populated with hopes, ambitions, loved-ones, and emotions.

                    <h2>Change</h2>
                    Did you notice anything different? A change you hadn't yet realized? Maybe it is as simple as the cherry blossom trees. What color are they now? It wasn't very long ago at all that they had those beautiful pink petals. Did you take the time to appreciate them the brief period they were around? Perhaps you'll be here to see them again next year. Or maybe your future has other plans. It is likely that you think ahead like this often, so many of us always so focused on later and whats to come. It can make it difficult to recognize the changes that are happening now.
