        <h1>24 Hours without My Phone</h1>
        <p>
            My experience during the 24 hours without my cellphone 
            was somehow both just as difficult and far easier than
            I thought it would be, all depending on the moment.<br>
    
            <br>To prepare for the day beforehand I mainly just tried
            to message people I regularly talk to, I gave out my 
            email a lot to people like my lab partner who might need
            to stay in touch with me. I made plans with friends for the 
            night so I had something to distract myself and make the time 
            go by faster.<br>
    
            <br>I also tried to consume as much social media as possible 
            the night before, knowing I wouldn't be able to the next day. 
            This ended up being a mistake as the next day the first thing
            I wanted to do was open my phone and resume looking at what 
            I had been looking into on social media the night before 
            (the 1st round of NFL draft had just occurred so that was 
            really on my mind).<br>
    
            <br>Most of the early parts of the day went by quickly. I had
            work from around 9am til 3:30pm which was super easy to get through
            since I don't really look at my phone while working. It was during 
            the moments I wasn't busy at work, like breaks, that did end up being 
            and issue. Even though I only had to sit there for my tens and thirty 
            minute breaks not being able to check my phone and see what I had missed
            while working really got to me. Even though I knew I had nothing I
            couldn't afford to miss I still felt stressed.<br>

            <br>It was these same moments where I wasn't able to keep myself busy
            that I really struggled with. In <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/06/technology/smartphone-addiction-flip-phone.html">Switching to a Flip Phone Helped Me Cut Down on My Smartphone Addiction</a> Kashmir Hill notes
            how she doesn't get FIFO even though she isn't using her cellphone.<br>
            
            <br>I can confidently say this was not the case for me. I related far more to the article <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/opinion/twitter-odell-time.html">What twitter does to our sense of time</a>
            which really highlighted how social media makes the less
            exciting or fast-pace parts of life harder to enjoy. There's just This constant urge to check for updates or to see if anything is going on. 
            You want to see what people are talking about.<br>

            <br>This urge to check twitter or scroll tiktok did start to affect 
            my ability to interact in-person later in the day. My friends kept yelling at me for not wanting to do anything but I was really just in a bad mood because of the whole phone thing. Going to the gym without 
            being able to listen to music was also one of the worst things I've ever 
            had to do.</br>
